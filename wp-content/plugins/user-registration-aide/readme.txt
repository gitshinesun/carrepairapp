Adds custom user fields to better manage users & members & customize login-registration page css & messages. Lets you customize the entire user management experience to your own liking!

Note: WordPress 4.4 or higher is required due to new error handling procedures.

== Description ==

Customize the entire user management experience to your own liking!. Now you can have all user management features in one plugin! Includes New User Approve and Email Verification Features new in 1.5.3.0 and optional lost password security questions. Also allows you to add additional fields of any input type to registration form and profile for better user management and control. Customize the Default WordPress Registration Form & Login Page CSS & Messaging.  It also helps reduce unwanted spam registrations. Has anti-spam built in, customize default WordPress login/registration forms both in design and messaging, adds agreement policy and link to policy to registration form for members, can create custom redirects after login and registration, templates for password change and lost password and email verification, custom password strength options, and password update management. Can limit amount of time between password changes and the number of times before duplicate passwords allowed, set minimum password length and also require special characters, upper and lower case letters and numbers so your site is made more secure. New templates allow you to use custom password strength for both lost password and reset password options.   

WordPress User Registration Aide allows you to require more fields when a new user registers. This not only can help to stop spammers, but it can also increase your user management capabilities and services for your user base. All the new fields that you add also are added to existing users profiles, but the users will have to fill them out of course, but any new users will be required to fill out these fields if they are included in the registration process. The new fields can be any variety, select, text, radio button or checkbox, and all the standard html input types, and optional if you like. 

New in 1.5.3.0
New User Approve Feature
New User Email Verification Feature
Lost Password Reset Form Security Question for added Security.
All user features are added to the all users table for easy access to approve, deny, resend emails, activate, and delete denied users.

Another important option is that you can also add new fields to the users profile page but not require them for registration, so you can increase you user management capabilities. This is an exciting new feature for Web-masters that wish to increase contact options, communications, and information obtained from your user base.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a shortcode?  =

No, there currently is no shortcode as it uses the current registration/profile actions and filters for WordPress so it shows up without the need for a shortcode.

= Where are the new fields? =

First, you need to make sure you are allowing new users to register for your site which is found on the general settings tab on the admin dashboard under membership, make sure you have the Anyone can register checkbox checked.

Then, if you don't know where it is the registration form is on the login form, as there should be a register link at the bottom of the login form page if you are allowing anyone to sign up. Click on the register link to see the registration form and your new extra fields.

= Any Known Installation Issues? =

Yes, with W3 Total Cache activated there will be errors thrown when creating the new template pages. It will say post_permalink is deprecated if you have error reporting on, and apparently will prevent activation on some sites from my understanding. I have no idea when they will fix that and there is nothing we can do at this point in time, others have addressed this issue on their support page but they are still using deprecated code and generating errors. What you can do to work around this is before activating User Registration Aide, deactivate W3 Total Cache and activate USer Registration Aide and then reactivate W3 Total Cache.
 
For the Email Verification and other functions to work properly you must have the Permalink Structure set to Post Name, otherwise you will get Error 404 Page Not Found Errors!
